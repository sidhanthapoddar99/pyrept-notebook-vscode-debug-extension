# Debug Notebook Extension

A VS Code extension that provides a notebook interface where code cells execute directly in the debug console, combining the interactive experience of notebooks with the power of VS Code's debugging capabilities.

## Features

- üìì Create and edit notebook files with `.dnb` extension
- üêç Support for Python and JavaScript code execution
- üîÑ Persistent state between cell executions
- üêõ Integration with VS Code's debug infrastructure
- üìù Mix code and markdown cells for documentation
- üíæ Save and load notebook files

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.90.0 or later
- Python extension (for Python support)
- Node.js (for JavaScript support)

## Installation

1. Download from VS Code Marketplace (when published)
2. Or install from VSIX file:
   - Download the `.vsix` file
   - In VS Code, go to Extensions view
   - Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Install from VSIX..."

## Quick Start

1. Create a new Debug Notebook:
   - Command Palette ‚Üí "Debug Notebook: New Debug Notebook"
   - Or create a file with `.dnb` extension

2. Write code in cells:
   ```python
   # Python example
   message = "Hello, Debug Notebook!"
   print(message)
   ```

3. Run cells using the play button or `Shift+Enter`

## How It Works

This extension uses VS Code's Debug Adapter Protocol to execute code cells. Instead of running a separate kernel process like Jupyter, it leverages existing debug adapters:

- Code execution happens via DAP `evaluate` requests
- Output is captured through debug output events
- State persists within the debug session
- No separate kernel process needed

## Development

### Setup

## Known Issues

- Rich output (graphs, images) not supported
- Breakpoints cannot be set directly in cell code
- Performance may be slower than native execution for heavy computations
